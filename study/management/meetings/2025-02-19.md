## Agenda

1.  Understanding the biological relevance of the PrsA2-LLO interaction.
2.  Evaluating the necessity of Domain 4 in LLO for cholesterol binding.
3.  Investigating the role of PrsA2 in inhibiting pore formation and aggregation.
4.  Discussing Listeria monocytogenes escape from the phagosome.
5.  Identifying computational approaches for studying PrsA2-LLO stability and dissociation

## Summary

During the meeting, we discussed the biological significance of the PrsA2-LLO interaction and how simulations could help analyze this process before conducting experiments. Laty Cahoon led the discussion, emphasizing the importance of understanding how PrsA2 influences LLO functionality under different conditions.

It was observed that Domain 4 in LLO is necessary for cholesterol binding, a crucial step in its function. However, PrsA2 appears to block this interaction, potentially regulating LLO activity under specific conditions. Since cholesterol binding is essential for LLO function, studying how PrsA2 modulates this interaction could provide insights into its biological role. Furthermore, under cytosolic conditions, LLO pore formation is undesirable, as it could be detrimental to the bacterial cell. PrsA2 may bind to LLO in the cytosol to inhibit this process. Additionally, LLO has been shown to aggregate in cytosolic conditions when PrsA2 is absent, suggesting that PrsA2 also plays a role in preventing aggregate formation and maintaining LLO in a functional state.

Another key discussion point was how Listeria monocytogenes escape the phagosome at pH 5. For bacterial escape, PrsA2 must be released from LLO, allowing LLO to form pores in the membrane. This suggests a pH-dependent regulation mechanism, which remains unclear and requires further investigation. Understanding how LLO transitions from an inhibited to an active state is a crucial study area.

## Next steps

-   Characterize the stability of the PrsA2-LLO interaction at different pH levels, particularly at pH 5 and 7, to determine if pH shifts alone can modulate binding affinity.
